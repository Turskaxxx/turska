            <p class="infoboxx"><strong>BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT MANAGER/STORE MANAGER - GROUP NORDICA FINLAND OY — 01/2020-
                ></strong><br>
                I am currently working in Nippon Sport / Group Nordica Finland as a Business Development Manager.
                My tasks include maintaining and developing store processes which include normal
                store functions, customer service both in store and via phone and net based channels,
                buying, web store orders, in-house logistics and other things. This role is mostly administrative now that the processes work.<br>
                I also run logistics development projects and various other projects on the side.</p>
                <p class="infoboxx"><strong>ENTREPRENEUR - CATMANIA/HIERONTATURO.FI - MASSAGE THERAPY/TRAINER —
                    09/2017-03/2020</strong><br>
                    I was working as an entrepreneur at my own location in Kirkkonummi Finland. I built
the company from scratch and the only aspect I have not done by myself is the web
based appointment calendar. My goal was to found a functioning company, acquire
enough clients and build up to an adequate level within a years time. Even though
there was moderate competition in the are and the field, I reached that level within six
months. After two years the level was excellent and I was been able to hire one
employee too.<br>
Upon moving, I sold my business to my employee and am currently doing very little
training and massage therapy as a side business.<br>
Besides the client work my responsibilities include website administering, SEO, social
media marketing and content creation, Google Ads, Google business and other
supporting functions.</p>    
<p class="infoboxx"><strong>VARUSTELEKA OY - SALES DIRECTOR — 02/2014-08/2015</strong><br>
    I ran a project having to do with improving the B2B functions and creating a new
account management system. The goal was to integrate B2B related functions into the
new ERP and CRM systems.<br>
One of my other main responsibilities was the demand analysis regarding events and
creating a new events procedures based on this analysis. I created new ways of
working and a method where the new systems were integrated to event management
both in-house events and events around the country. This made taking part in events
easier and laid foundations to their current events curriculum.<br>
I took part in marketing decisions mostly regarding synergistic and co-operative cases
and did some creative work in collaboration with the marketing manager. I also
modelled and acted in various marketing photos and videos. The article database was
my responsibility, I was in charge of food related issues, acquired alcohol sales permits
and was a part of the management group.<br>
Because workplace wellbeing is important to me, I injected myself into wellness
projects and did my part in generating activities and such accordingly.</p>
